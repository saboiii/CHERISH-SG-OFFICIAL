# CHERISH-SG-OFFICIAL
 
I initiated and led a passion project known as CHERISH SG that aims to raise awareness about the unaddressed societal issues faced by essential workers and to promote empathy and understanding among the public. The CHERISH website was designed using original art that was inspired by paintings from the National Museum of Singapore that depict the cultural and historical significance of essential workers in the country. I made this full stack blog web app using Next.js, React libraries, Tailwind CSS, MongoDB with a fully functioning account authentication system made using Auth.js and an admin dashboard. This website even utilises Nodemailer to handle contact forms and displays blogposts in an interactive carousel. I carried out 20 street interviews to obtain real-time data regarding the publicâ€™s views on essential workers and analysed this information for our research articles. This helped raise awareness regarding unkindness towards essential workers. We managed to raise about S$150 by selling bracelets that we chose to donate to Health serve, an IPC registered charity that seeks to bring healing and hope to vulnerable low-wage migrant workers in Singapore.
